# Slack unfurl bot for Teamrowk Projects

> Unfurl webhook which adds useful metadata to the links to Teamwork Project when shared on Slack.


## :warning: Risk of Information Disclosuere/Data Leak :warning:

Be very careful of using this bot, as it can lead to information disclosure!

This bot has currently no authentication feature, so if the URL of the bot is discovered anyone can basically dump a lot of metadata from your Teamwork instalaltion!

ðŸ’¡ As precaution you could add basic-auth on a reverse proxy or even better implement a token validation to the bot's URL.
